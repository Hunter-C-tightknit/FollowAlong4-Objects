//        "if you would like a copy of all this code"
// Guide: GUIDE.md in this folder, Video 2 — the same lesson, written out step by step
//
// Part 15, video 2 — objects (object-oriented programming)
//
// SECTION A — FOLLOW ALONG: type the code from the video (or the guide).
//    His class with main is called Main. Yours is called ObjectOriented.
//    Leave the "package part15;" line and the "public class ObjectOriented" line alone.
//    He also makes a second class called Car. YOU make that file too:
//    right-click the part15 folder -> New -> Java Class -> type Car -> Enter.
//
// SECTION B — COMMENTS: when you finish, put a // comment ABOVE every line of code,
//    in THIS file AND in Car.java, saying in YOUR OWN WORDS what that line does.
